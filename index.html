        <h1>The “Basic 13”</h1>
    </summary>
    <details>
        <p>These are Coding Dojo's foundation “Basic 13” algorithm challenges. For each, write JavaScript function - a suggested function name is included below. By clicking the button below each problem, the answer will be revealed. Since the challenge is to print answers in the console, I put them in an array or return the final answer. Some, however, you'll need to see by opening the console yourself! Can you finish all of these challenges in less than two minutes each?</p>
